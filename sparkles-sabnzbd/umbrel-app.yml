  SABnzbd makes Usenet as simple and streamlined as possible by automating everything we can. All you have to do is add an .nzb.
  SABnzbd takes over from there, where it will be automatically downloaded, verified, repaired, extracted and filed away with zero human interaction.
  SABnzbd offers an easy setup wizard and has self-analysis tools to verify your setup.

  🛠️ SET-UP INSTRUCTIONS 🛠️


  1. Integrating with Other Applications: If you want to integrate SABnzbd with other applications such as Sonarr or Radarr, you'll need to use the IP address of your Umbrel device as the 'Host' and use 9876 as the 'Port'.
  You can find the IP address of your Umbrel device by checking your router's admin dashboard or by using an IP scanning tool like Angry IP Scanner.
