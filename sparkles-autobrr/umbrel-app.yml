description: >-
  Many indexers announce new torrents on their IRC channels the second it is uploaded to the site.

  autobrr monitors such channels in real time and grabs the torrent file as soon as it's uploaded based on certain conditions that you set up within autobrr.

  It then sends that torrent file to a download client of your choice. A download client can be anything from qBittorrent, Deluge, SABnzbd, Radarr, Sonarr, watch folder, etc.
